I decided to learn how to interact with computer vision models using the FastAI infrastructure.  
The coursework is taught by Jeremy Howard - former President and Chief Scientist at Kaggle and long time AI leader.  


Here's the embedded notebook for the first lesson (also available [directly on Kaggle][1]).  
The goal was to learn how to use the fastai toolkit for a simple image classification problem.  
I chose a difficult task for humans to do: differentiate between chihuahuas and blueberry muffins.
