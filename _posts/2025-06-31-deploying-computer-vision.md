#### Try It Yourself
- [ðŸ§ª Lightweight JavaScript demo]({{ "/hfapi" | relative_url }})
- [ðŸš€ Full-featured Gradio app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/morescode-pm/urbanrivers-camtraps)

1. Training  
 - Downloading  
 - Cleaning  
 - Iterating & Next Steps (MD, SN, RN)  
2. Saving  
3. Predicting - HF Gradio
4. Lightweight API


# TODO - Model Improvements
Trim top and bottom off photo when predicting to avoid leakage.
Bounding Box Crop Version Like SpeciesNet
Train from SpeciesNet



# The goal - Drivetrain
Spread the usage of floating wetlands to improve urban environments for animals and humans.
Proving benefits through study of the changes in wildlife and human use in and along the chicago river.
How? Through tracking changes in biodiversity, markers of health, and species abundance before and after the installation of floating wetlands.
How? At least in-part through observations made using motion capture cameras (and microscopes)

Because motion capture cameras have a high false positive image capture rate ( nothing in the picture ) - using computer vision to accelerate data capture.
Also correct identification requires some specialized knowledge - 

So we're making use of volunteer labeling to train AI.
