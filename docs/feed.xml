Even after purchasing a domain, figuring out the DNS records for github, and getting an HTML page initially stood up there was still a lot to learn.</p>

<p>Here are the steps I followed on windows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download Ruby (with Bundler by default) and Jekyll on Windows
    <ul>
      <li>Here’s the <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">Ruby+Devkit</a> for windows install page - I had to use 3.3.8-1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read a bunch of how to guides that are based on varying deployments of jekyll and jekyll themes
    <ul>
      <li>Here’s a link to the most comprehensive walkthrough when using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">github pages with Jekyll</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Double check that all software installed correctly in the Path variable.
    <ul>
      <li>This includes not installing the most up to date version of jekyll because github pages uses an older version. They will likely not update because of stability concerns for users.</li>
      <li>Confirm installs with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll -v</code>  and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby-v</code></li>
      <li>Very important Gemfile line: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem "github-pages", "~&gt; 232", group: :jekyll_plugins</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Spend a lot of time figuring out what the _config.yml file does and how to configure it.</li>
  <li>Learn about what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gems</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundler</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> are for and what jinja syntax is being used in jekyll.</li>
  <li>More that I thought to myself “wow this would be good to write down” but didn’t.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
What you get for all the effort:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong thematic elements across all pages.</li>
  <li>A templating implementation to avoid repeating yourself in html.</li>
  <li>The option to write posts in markdown and html - instead of all html.</li>
  <li>Examples from other users that you can use to improve your own site.</li>
  <li>An easy and auto-reloading localhost:4000 testing environment
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ultimately, the knowledge of how to do this again in the future and a fast way to add new projects.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Example Analysis:</em></p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0"> October 2023 was less profitable than 2022 by $0.15M:</h2>
<p>Focusing on the Gross Profit Year to Date (YTD) vs Prior Year to Date (PYTD) Waterfall Chart for 2023.<br />
It looks like October was our worst performing month relative to last year - we want to know why so we can make decisions to increase profitability next year.</p>

<p>First, hover over and then click on the “Click to turn on Drill down” arrow (1). Then click on the red bar for October (2).<br />
<img src="/assets/images/learning-powerbi/1_DrillDown.png" /></p>

<p>This waterfall chart has drill down information about country and product - when clicking on October, the first layer of detail shows us a list of all countries and their relative gross profit between 2023 and 2022. Here we can see 79k of the $148.41k less profit in 2023 came from accounts in China. This is reflected across all visuals in the dashboard as well and hovering over will show you more information.
<img src="/assets/images/learning-powerbi/2_Countries.png" /></p>

<p>Drilling further down by clicking on china we get a grouping by product category: Indoor, Landscape, and Outdoor.<br />
It looks like in 2023 we lost money on Outdoor and Landscape products but making small returns on Indoor products vs 2022. Remember, at this point we are drilled down on “Gross Profit YTD (2023) vs PYTD (2022) for October 2023, from China.”
<img src="/assets/images/learning-powerbi/3_ProductGroup.png" /></p>

<p>Focusing in further on Outdoor we can get an idea of which specific plants are experiencing lower gross profits in 2023. For example, 4 of these products had $9-10k less gross profits in 2023 than 2022 - something definitely worth looking into more. (and we would repeat this for Landscape).
<img src="/assets/images/learning-powerbi/4_Products.png" /></p>

<p>To get a final list of the products we can just request a table view by right clicking on the graph. Tip: Use portrait or landscape view to  (because, yeah, reading long names from angled bar titles isn’t great) 
<img src="/assets/images/learning-powerbi/5_Tabled.png" /></p>

<p>Remember - this does not mean the products LOST money, it just means relative to last year they made less. So, maybe the products are falling out of favor in china, or maybe in 2022 there was an issue with these. It could also mean that the products are more perrenial, and in 2022 companies bought all the needed. So, when thinking about the next year we could update the catalog to offer products that are in more demand and produce less of the products out of demand for the chinese market.<br />
We could also look deeper at the account profitability segments, and try to advertize to the accounts related that are low value YTD, but high GP% (bottom right figure of the dashboard).</p>

I chose a difficult task for humans to do: differentiate between chihuahuas and blueberry muffins.</p>
